# Format: host:port or host:port:username:password for authenticated proxies
# Remove the '#' character at the beginning of the line to activate a proxy

# 192.168.1.1:8080
# proxy1.example.com:3128
# proxy2.provider.com:8080

# Example authenticated proxies (if your proxies require authentication)
# proxy.example.com:8080:username:password

# You can add your actual proxies below this line
# Make sure to remove the '#' from the beginning of the line
